Complete 90s vibe with this one, a friend introduced me to this and have been hooked ever since, the breaks the hands in the air piano and wicked vocal.

# Therapy

The cut was so deep, it's taken so long to say
He got me on my knees, down and praying
Hoping that you'll take me to a place
Somewhere there's no more pain

Therapy or something stronger
Anything to take me away
I'm jonesing for another day with you
Need your love to look my way

Our love
Our love, baby
Our love
Our love, I love you, baby

All I wanna do is get on with the start
'Cause it won't stop ticking away my life
You and me, we got a little time
To take what we can and leave the rest behind

I'm ready for something deeper
Come on, let's give it a name
I'm jonesing for another day with you
Need your love to look my way

Our love
Our love, baby
Our love
Our love, baby

I feel love
I am ready
I feel love

I feel it
I can feel it
I feel whole again
I love you, baby

Our love
Our love, baby
Our love
Our love, I love you, baby

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby
I love you, baby
