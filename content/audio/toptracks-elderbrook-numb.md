# Numb

Oh, that's just how it goes
Risin', risin' up
Right until we fall

Oh, reachin' in the dark
Nothing's there to touch
I wish I could love

Oh, that's just how it goes
Risin', risin' up
Right until we fall

Oh, reachin' in the dark
Nothing's there to touch
I wish I could love

But I'm still numb
But I'm still numb
I'm still numb
And the feeling's gone
But I'm still numb
Love, I can't be the only one

Oh, that's just how it goes
Risin', risin' up
Right until we fall

Oh, reachin' in the dark
Nothing's there to touch
I wish I could love

But I'm still numb
But I'm still numb

But I'm still numb
And the feeling's gone
But I'm still numb
Love, I can't be the only one
But I'm still numb
And the feeling's gone
But I'm still numb
Love, I can't be the only one

Oh, that's just how it goes
Risin', risin' up
Right until we fall
